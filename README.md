## Purpose
 - This full-stack web application simulates a food ordering system providing online ordering and restaurants management by using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Demo
 - The application has been deployed on Heroku:
 https://frances-food-ordering.herokuapp.com

## Functionalities
 - A (registered and) logged-in user can place a new order from a selected restaurant. After the order is successfully placed, the user can rate it. They can also browse the profile and order history of any other user whose profile is public.
 - An admin of the system can browse the list of restaurants, add a new restaurant, modify any existing restaurant (including its menu), and can also view the sales statistics of all restaurants, such as their most popular dishes.
